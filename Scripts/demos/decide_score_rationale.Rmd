Short piece to outline the rationale behind the decide score.

# The aims

what we want, how we want it to work across species etc

# how to do that?

The different components that we can use

# the DECIDE score

Why we have chosen to use the preds*sqrt(var) and mean weighted by probability of presence within a grid cell 

# what we can do with this

We can alter the colour scheme to highlight different areas
this is based only on the model
we can include other 'variables' as we see fit, e.g. phenology, conservation concern, etc...
